                    <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">If you receive a notification that a skigit has been removed due a copyright complaint, it means that the skigit's content has been deleted from Skigit at the request of the content's owner. If your account receives too many copyright complaints, you may lose the ability to create new content on Skigit, and your account may be disabled completely. <span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">If you believe a skigit was removed in error, you have the option to file a counter-notice by following the steps below. When we receive a valid counter-notice, we will forward a copy to the person who filed the original complaint. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the submitter of the original complaint is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the content at issue, we will remove the complaint from your account's record, and we may replace the content that was removed.</span></span> <span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">Note: There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Before submitting a counter-notice, be sure that you are the actual rights holder of the removed content or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.</span></p>
