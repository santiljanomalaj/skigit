            <h3>What if I receive a Copyright Complaint (DMCA) notification?</h3>
            <p>If you receive a notification that a skigit has been removed due a copyright complaint, it means that
              the skigit's content has been deleted from Skigit at the request of the content's owner. If your account
              receives too many copyright complaints, you may lose the ability to create new content on Skigit, and your
              account may be disabled completely. If you believe a skigit was removed in error, you have the option to
              file a counter-notice by following the steps below. When we receive a valid counter-notice, we will
              forward a copy to the person who filed the original complaint. If we do not receive notice within 10
              business days that the submitter of the original complaint is seeking a court order to prevent further
              infringement of the content at issue, we will remove the complaint from your account's record, and we may
              replace the content that was removed.
              Note: There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Before
              submitting a counter-notice, be sure that you are the actual rights holder of the removed content or that
              you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and understand the repercussions of
              submitting a false claim.
            </p>

            <h3>How to File a Counter-Notice</h3>
