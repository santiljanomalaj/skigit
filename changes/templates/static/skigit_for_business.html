            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">Peter Eckert (July 2012, <em>Impact of mobile devices on ecommerce</em>)...<em>"Fueling the Internet's next evolution, mobile devices are solidifying the new retail experience from bricks-and-mortar to the ease of click-to-order. With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, mobile commerce is expected to grow significantly over the next three years."</em></span>
            </p>

            <h3 class="sageo">Here's How it Works</h3>

            <h3 class="sageo">Offer Users Incentives and Rewards to Create Skigits for your brand!</h3>
            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">It's been reported that less than 1% of daily active users are engaging your content on other social networks. &nbsp;In other words 99% of the content that brands put up there is being ignored because the content has no relevance to the audience, at least not enough relevance to share with others.&nbsp;Study after study show that people "Like" brand and corporate pages mainly to&nbsp;find out about specials,&nbsp;get discounts, updates, and so on.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">At Skigit we feel that offering users incentives and rewards just to like your brand is a diluted form of earned-media and by offering users incentives and rewards to create a skigit for your brand about a product that they already like and are willing to "actively" promote, is what "true" earned media value is all about. No other site provides your brand this level of earned media value. . NONE!</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">We recommend that you offer incentives to spread your brand and product awareness virally so here are some of our suggestions:</span>
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><span
                  style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;"><strong>Offer Product Discounts</strong> &ndash;
                A study by ExactTarget and CoTweet found that&nbsp;40% of people like brands to receive discounts and coupons.&nbsp;Discount Coupons are a proven&nbsp;great &nbsp;incentive for &nbsp;users and by creating a skigit for you, your users have displayed a intimate connection with your brand and product. So&nbsp;is it worth it to offer users product discounts for creating a video promotion for your product? Uh huh!!<br>
                            </span></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><span
                  style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;"><strong>Discount Coupons</strong> are a proven&nbsp;great &nbsp;incentive for &nbsp;users and by creating a skigit for you, your users have displayed a intimate connection with your brand and product. So&nbsp;is it worth it to offer users product coupons for creating a video promotion for your product? Um, we think so.! &nbsp;</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3 class="sageo">Let YOUR Consumers do the talking for YOUR Brand!</h3>
            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">It all starts here! You upload your logo into your business account profile and let our members do the rest! Immediately, your logo becomes available for use by our members...those consumers that you are looking to reach out to. Each time a member chooses to display your logo in association with their favorite thing depicted in their skigit, your business identity and brand instantly have the potential to go viral. As members display their awesome experiences to the world, those experiences are <span
                style="color: #000000;">VIEWED, PLUGGED, SHARED, and POSTED to other social networks. And when that happens, your products, services, brand and identity go along with it.</span></span>
              &nbsp; <span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">And that's not all! Each time a member chooses to display your logo in a skigit and that skigit is viewed by either a member or non-member, you have made a unique emotional connection with your consumers. This sentiment isn't simply an advertisement from the brand manufacturer. It's a glimpse of a human experience or a depiction of an experience that your consumer feels so strongly about, that they can't wait to share it with viewers. This is the true power of Skigit and this power lies in the hands of each member.&nbsp; When the skigit is created, it becomes a credible testimonial about you by your consumer through the sincerity and passion of your consumers. Isn't that what it's all about!</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">With the very nature of a skigit being a video sketch of a positive experience and favorite thing, <span
                style="color: #000000;">there are no "unfavorable" skigits, </span>no negative information intended or allowed. In fact, each skigit is screened for content to make sure that it meets our <em><span
                style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a target="_blank"

            <p><span style="font-family: 'LAO UI',arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">How would you like to drive massive amounts traffic to your target locations such as product ecommerce&nbsp;targets and your company website? We've already established that by making your logo available to other members for use, you will be better able to establish and promote your brand identity, products and services. But the payoff happens exponentially when members propagate your logo, which is a "clickable"&nbsp;active image link within Skigit. As a result, each time a member clicks on the logo, now attached to member skigits, they are taken to your Skigit company profile page. Within&nbsp;your profile, you can add as many as&nbsp;five external links to you favorite company URLs. Viewers will be directed to the target locations of <strong>YOUR CHOICE</strong>. This allows you to drive traffic to your site or to&nbsp;your product and services ecommerce locations or simply provide information&nbsp;to viewers about you and the products and services you offer.&nbsp;In other words, Skigit gets your brand identity, products and services recognized naturally and effortlessly through organic social promotion and interest.&nbsp;All you have to do is&nbsp;sit back and let Skigit&nbsp;work for you!</span>
