        I found an awesome video website where members create short videos about the things they love and 
        want to share with others. You can even get free stuff just by posting the logo of the maker 
        of your favorite thing with your video. If you don't want the free stuff, you can donate to your 
        favorite non-profit organization. Poast videos of your stuff ...receive

    <h5>That's Awesome!</h5>
